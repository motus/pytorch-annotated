# PyTorch Annotated

This repository is a collection of python3 notebooks exploring individual components of PyTorch
framework. You can view it as a hands-on tutorial in PyTorch for someone who is already familiar
with Python and machine learning.

Our approach is inspired by a classical book,
[The Little Schemer](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/index.html).

For now, there are only a few documents here:

* [MNIST example dissected](mnist/) (only the first two chapters finished)
* [Anatomy of the serialized MNIST model](load/state_dict.ipynb)
* [libtorch classes and code generation](libtorch/1_libtorch_classes.md)
