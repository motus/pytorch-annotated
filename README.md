# PyTorch Annotated

This repository is a collection of python3 notebooks exploring individual components of PyTorch
framework. You can view it as a hands-on tutorial in PyTorch for someone who is already familiar
with Python and machine learning.

Our approach is inspired by a classical book,
[The Little Schemer](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/index.html).

For now, there is only one chapter here, [MNIST example dissected](mnist/)
